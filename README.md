## 🛡️ Why the Code Is Private

This is an original full-stack project I built to showcase:
- Clean architecture
- Real-world auth logic (JWT + refresh tokens)
- UX-focused design
- Authentication flow with refresh tokens
- Secure cookie handling
- Real world problem solving

To protect the effort I put in (and avoid clones if I want to turn this into a startup in the future), the source code is private — but I’m happy to share it with recruiters or collaborators upon request.
